## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ChronixV2.

To contribute, please fork the repository and make your changes in your own fork, ensuring to pull from this repository frequently. Once your changes are complete, open an issue describing the update and attach a .zip archive containing ONLY the modified files.

ChronixV2 uses an automated update workflow that clones the main repository, applies server-side modifications, and submits updates back to this repository automatically.
Because of this process, feature additions and custom modifications are maintained separately, then cleanly merged into the primary codebase before being pushed here.

## How to Use

1. **Install FSL (optional but recommended)**  
   - Download the latest version of **FSL** from [UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/grand-theft-auto-v/616977-fsl-local-gtao-saves.html).
   - Place `version.dll` into your GTA V installation directory.
   - *Note*: Using FSL is optional, but highly recommended for enhanced account safety.

2. **Download ChronixV2**
   - Get the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Deadlineem/ChronixV2/releases/download/nightly/ChronixV2.dll).

3. **Obtain an Injector**
   - Download an injector such as [FateInjector](https://github.com/fligger/FateInjector/releases/download/1.0/FateInjector.exe).

4. **Prepare GTA V**
   - Open **Rockstar Launcher**.
   - Select **Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced** → **Settings** → **Disable BattlEye**.
   - If using **Steam** or **Epic Games**, you may also need to set the launch option: `-nobattleye`.

5. **Launch and Inject**
   - Start GTA V and wait for the main menu to load.
   - Use your injector to inject `ChronixV2.dll` into the game process.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### ➤ Frequent Desyncs from Public Sessions
- ChronixV2 does **not** currently include a BattlEye bypass to play with other players.
- Without a bypass, legitimate hosts will eventually remove you due to a heartbeat failure.
- **Solution**: There is no current fix without using a private bypass.

### ➤ Progress Lost After Removing FSL
- FSL reroutes account save data to your local hard disk.
- Progress made while using FSL will **only appear** when FSL is enabled.
- **Solution**: Re-enable FSL to recover your progress or continue without it, knowing the save states are separate.

### ➤ Game Fails to Start After Removing FSL
- This is a known issue.
- **Solution**: Delete the following directory:
